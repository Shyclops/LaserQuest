Plan 1
Theme: Revolving trap
Three floors
Top floor is extremely small and only fit small amounts of people however it is extremely exposed and will yield great benefits
Four platforms on all sides will have a straight path at shooting the center
Middle floor will have few hiding spots from top and lower floor
Lower floor will have platforms
Highest floor will have turret that can rapid tag people for 10 sec, will instantly shut off if person using it tagged
A set of revolving walls will slowly rotate around the entire arena during the game and force players to move around and not stay in one spot
 
Plan 2
Theme: King of the hill
To get to second platform, players must go around the entire arena then they need to climb on a ramp that runs along the outer wall for entire perimeter
Second floor has free reign to shoot people underneath while people underneath can also shoot up
Second floor still has advantage as most people donâ€™t focus above them allowing them to tag others before they are tagged
Not everybody will want to be on top floor as it is much easier to tag people on second floor
People must start from the furthest area and work their way to the center before being able to go up the ramp to the second floor
doors open and close at random times

Plan 3:
Theme: Modern ruins
Modern looking buildings that are in ruins serve as shelter and maze
Roads connect everything
Second floor is slightly less broken buildings that will have a ramp leading up
Random taller ruins will obstruct some shots on the higher level
Circle ruins eliminate hiding spots and allow customizability for each game
ruins can lift up and rotate
lots of windows and holes in the ruins to allow for easy shooting
long shots can be done on the road and on top of buildings
